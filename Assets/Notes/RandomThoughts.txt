Ghost movement
Ideas: Mirror player, copy player, don't move at all

Copy player is kind of disorientating. If you were facing the ghost and swap, you would be facing away from the old position.

Mirror player might cause players to spin around a lot. Would need to test it. But swapping while facing ghost would be face to face.

Don't move at all would make moving both character's tedious.

I'll start off with just trying to copy position first. Then mirror across an axis (Would I just negate tranformation across the mirror axis?)
