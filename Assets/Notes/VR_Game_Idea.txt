Portal Inspired

Test chambers.
2 Entities, player and "ghost"
Chambers are split down the middle. 
Ghost mimics player's movement.
Players can swap between ghost at any time. 
	(Maybe fields that disable switching?)

Complete chambers by getting to end of level. Portal-style

Puzzle Idea:
	Ball on a button.
	Ball exists on side B
	There is a ramp between sides.
	Ramp leads to "lava" or that portal muck water.
	Solution: Swap, pick up ball, place ball on ramp, swap, grab ball before rolls off, place on button. Win!

Critical features:
Player must move 2 characters on same input.
Swapping must not disorient player.
Good physics system. Hopefully unity is good enough.

"Easily" make multiplayer co op maps.

This will make me famous.

Try it out. This may be really fun.
